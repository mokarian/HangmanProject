Hangman Project:
=====================
The Hangman is a game for two players. One player thinks of a word (Word Chooser) and the other (Word guesser) tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses depending on the length of the word. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. If the Word Guesser suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in its correct positions. If the suggested letter or number does not occur in the word, the number of remaining guesses will be deducted.
If the word guesser has made enough incorrect guesses which varies depending on the length of the chosen word, the game is over with the guesser losing. However, the guesser can win by guessing all the letters or numbers that appears in the word, thereby completing the word, before the number of remaining guesses is finished.
Dashboards:
=====================
We have considered showing three dashboards on the screen:
Guess dashboard:correct guesses,wrong guesses
Status dashboard:winner or loser
Counter dashboard:how many guesses is left

Assumptions:
=====================
The minimum chosen word can be 3 characters. 
Difficulty:
Easy: double the size of the chosen word
Normal: 1.5 times the size of the chosen word
Hard: the same size of the chosen word
